## Application of Decision Tree Algorithm for Iris Flowers Classification 
The Iris dataset comprises 150 samples of iris flowers from three distinct species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.
Each sample is characterised by four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
The decision tree algorithm can be utilised for the classification of iris flowers into the Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica species,
based on the sepal width, sepal length, petal width, and petal length.
